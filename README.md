### Description:  
Our goal for this project was to see if we could improve a real-time object recognition algorithm (Darkflow/Tensorflow). We used three YouTube videos for a length of about 10 hours as the source of our data. These videos were converted to frames, then to grayscale, then to frame difference numbers, and finally into clips. We had a single pandas dataframe that served as our primary data set to mine, which we used to find clips of slow, medium and fast speeds. This in turn served as our test set for our algorithm called Cheapo.

### Questions:  
1 - Is it possible to modify the current best object classification algorithm to run quickly and accurately without needing a super computer?

2 - Can we find a way to reliably test an object detection algorithm on videos of varying speed and environments?

3 - Can we mine YouTube videos for interesting clips?

4 - Can we use these clips to improve an object detection algorithm?  
    
### Applications:  
By using our method of mining YouTube videos anyone is able to easily find a desired clip to test object detection. This method of sampling clips from a distribution means you can easily select clips that suit your testing needs, whether you want a fast or slow clip or if you want clips with lots of objects or just a few.  

As far as object detection goes, having a fast and accurate real-time object detection algorithm could allow cameras to constantly, and accurately, search for threats in public spaces. It could also be used to assist blind people by conveying their surrondings through audio.

As mentioned before, the applications are essentially limitless.
