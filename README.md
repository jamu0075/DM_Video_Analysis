### Description:  
Our goal for this project was to see if we could modify a real-time object recognition algorithm (Darkflow/Tensorflow) 
to predict the next location of an object.

### Questions:  
1. Is it even possible?  
    * Can we actually predict the next location using machine learning tools.  
2. What is the benefit?  
    * By being able to predict the next location of an object we can significantly reduce the processing time of  
    real-time video object recognition.
3. Why?
    * Currently object recognition is either really accurate and really slow or really fast and not so accurate. 
    We want a really fast and really accurate object recognition tool for real-time use. If object recognition is fast and  
    accurate in real time video the applications are essentially endless.  
    
### Applications:  
Having a fast and accurate real-time object detection algorithm could allow cameras to constantly, and accurately,
search for threats in public spaces. It could also be used to assist blind people by conveying their surrondings through audio.
As mentioned before, the applications are essentially limitless.
